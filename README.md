#Things I would have liked to implement, but time wasn't on my side:
-  Styling of filter elements
-  Flashier font/text
-  Refresh filters button
-  More colour
-  More animations

#Things I'm happy with:
-  MovieCard components are pretty neat
-  Managed pagination anyway (I think)
-  Mico-interactions such as card hover effects feel satisfying
-  It actually works :)
